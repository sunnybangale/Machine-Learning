
*****Programming language implemented - Python*****

*****Tools - Pycharm Jetbrains IDE / Anaconda (Jupyter notebook)*******

Steps to run the source code:

1. Copy the python file (ID3.py) and .csv files containing the datasets to your storage folder of the IDE (Pycharm Projects folder)

2. Create a new project in the Pycharm IDE and add the python file (source code) in the project.

3. Run the file through run section of the toolbar

4. Enter paths of the dataset files accordingly:
It will ask the following things after execution in the console:
	
	a) "Enter Training Dataset file path:"
		So we should enter: training_set1.csv      OR       training_set2.csv
	
	b) "Enter Validation Dataset file path:"
		So we should enter: validation_set1.csv	   OR       validation_set2.csv
	
	c) "Enter Testing Dataset file path:"
		So we should enter: test_set1.csv	  OR        test_set2.csv


Datasets:

There are 2 datasets containing each of the following files,
a) training_set.csv
b) validation_set.csv
c) test_set.csv

We have renamed the respective files to,
Dataset 1:
a) training_set1.csv
b) validation_set1.csv
c) test_set1.csv

Dataset 2:
a) training_set2.csv
b) validation_set2.csv
c) test_set2.csv
